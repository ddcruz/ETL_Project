## Project proposal guidelines
For our ETL project we’re going to download datasets from NOAA (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data) and The University of Colorado’s (https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/archives) sea ice index. We will separate the data into northern and southern hemispheres to compare the air / sea temperature and the rate of ice melt. We will transform the date and group by month and look at the data over a 10-20 year time period.
